Hawaii	2015-02-11T14:20:05.813Z	2015-02-11T14:20:10.133Z	Is this a duck quacking, or maybe a robot whale? Turns out these funny sounding beeps throughout the recordings actually have to do with the recording equipment.	Class Workshop	
Hawaii	2015-02-11T14:21:28.879Z	2015-02-11T14:25:15.781Z	These shapes reminded us of looking at an ancient alphabet.	Class Workshop	
Hawaii	2015-02-11T15:19:50.512Z	2015-02-11T15:19:55.954Z	Check out this backwards F shape. It sounds like two whales might be harmonizing!	Class Workshop	
Hawaii	2015-02-11T15:26:21.014Z	2015-02-11T15:26:31.350Z	Neat upward woop sounds repeated 7 times here.	Class Workshop	
Hawaii	2015-02-11T15:26:45.639Z	2015-02-11T15:26:50.998Z	Sounds a lot like an elephant.	Class Workshop	
Hawaii	2015-02-11T15:26:54.830Z	2015-02-11T15:26:58.302Z	The high-pitched squeaky sounds here are so interesting. Is that the whale producing those high sounds?	Class Workshop	
Hawaii	2015-02-17T04:55:18.597Z	2015-02-17T05:34:20.541Z	Does anyone know what causes this long, high-frequency glow?	Class Workshop	
Hawaii	2015-02-25T04:25:35.670Z	2015-02-25T04:26:21.105Z	See the upward bloop sounds? It's so interesting that the whale does 2 bloops, then 3, then 4, then 5, in sequence.	Class Workshop	
Hawaii	2014-12-06T05:13:06.654Z	2014-12-06T05:13:50.684Z	The humpback whales have arrived in Hawaii for breeding season! Zoom in to see the detailed spectrogram and to listen to distant singing. 	Annie Lewandowski	
Hawaii	2015-01-28T16:21:18.908Z	2015-01-28T16:22:21.167Z	Humpback whale song is composed of several unique themes that are constantly evolving as they are being sung. Listen to the phrase that is repeated within the theme here: a few, broad-spectrum upsweep sound units are followed by two sound units that each include a sustain and small sweep in frequency, the first of these at a mid-range frequency and the second at a higher-range frequency. Do you hear the slight differences with each repetition of the phrase? That's the individual voice and spontaneity of the composer! 	Annie Lewandowski	annie_first_theme
Hawaii	2015-01-28T16:22:22.167Z	2015-01-28T16:23:40.192Z	Notice how the theme we’ve been listening to changes here into something transitional, containing elements of the theme we just heard, and foreshadowing the theme that’s about to come. 	Annie Lewandowski	
Hawaii	2015-01-28T16:23:41.192Z	2015-01-28T16:28:41.192Z	The new theme! We hear a single, longer broad-spectrum upsweep, followed by a low-mid range sound unit that oscillates in pitch, which is followed by a high squeal. Again, notice how the articulation of all three sound units that make up this phrase are not exact with repetition. Can you describe the ways in which each sound unit is flexible? Notice the freedom within the structure.	Annie Lewandowski	annie_new_theme
Hawaii	2015-01-28T16:30:20.700Z	2015-01-28T16:32:24.281Z	Do you hear that familiar upsweep in the distance? Another whale! When breeding season is in full swing, a hydrophone can pick up (and your ears underwater can hear!) an asynchronous, barnyard chorus of male humpback whales singing. All male humpback whales within a population sing a similar, evolving song -  remarkable evidence of horizontal cultural transmission in a non-human.	Annie Lewandowski	
Hawaii	2015-01-28T16:33:24.281Z	2015-01-28T16:36:23.120Z	This is sound from a large ocean vessel covering the whole frequency spectrum of the humpback whale song. Marine scientist Chris Clark calls this cacophony of human-made noise [“acoustic bleaching”]( https://e360.yale.edu/features/how_ocean_noise_pollution_wreaks_havoc_on_marine_life) and it’s a real threat to the survival of humpback whales. These marine mammals can’t see beyond the length of their own bodies and use sound to facilitate diverse aspects of their survival.	Annie Lewandowski	
Hawaii	2015-01-28T17:25:39.240Z	2015-01-28T17:29:19.902Z	More acoustic bleaching from ship noise. While ship noise is a major concern, of even greater concern is seismic air gun blasting. Ocean exploration for oil and gas involves firing loud pressurized blasts of air through the ocean and into the seafloor every ten seconds creating a storm of noise [“six or seven orders of magnitude greater than the loudest ship sounds”]( https://e360.yale.edu/features/how_ocean_noise_pollution_wreaks_havoc_on_marine_life)	Annie Lewandowski	
Hawaii	2015-01-28T17:29:20.902Z	2015-01-28T17:30:07.754Z	As you hear the ship noise lessen here, can you hear the theme from earlier in the afternoon [at 16:31](#annie_new_theme) emerge?  	Annie Lewandowski	annie_second_theme
Hawaii	2015-01-28T17:31:07.754Z	2015-01-28T17:35:48.335Z	The next theme enters, composed of two sound units – one broad-spectrum upsweep followed by a mid-range sound unit that oscillates slightly, often bending up or down in pitch at the tail of the sound. 	Annie Lewandowski	annie_third_theme
Hawaii	2015-01-28T17:35:49.335Z	2015-01-28T17:36:28.228Z	This is where the transitional material begins – it contains elements of both the preceding and succeeding themes.	Annie Lewandowski	
Hawaii	2015-01-28T17:36:29.228Z	2015-01-28T17:38:53.605Z	Following the transitional material, here we begin listening to the solid statement of the next theme -  a short sustained sound (slightly higher in frequency than the lowest frequency of the former theme’s upsweep), followed by my favorite rumble-into-exasperation sound	Annie Lewandowski	
Hawaii	2015-01-28T17:38:54.605Z	2015-01-28T17:40:42.749Z	And the next theme! Two low grunts followed by 3-5 upsweeps	Annie Lewandowski	
Hawaii	2015-01-28T17:40:43.749Z	2015-01-28T17:41:32.093Z	This next theme is a real dazzler which points to whale behavior. This new theme is composed of  high squeals and “popcorn.” While I was in Hawaii in February 2019 with the Hawai’i Marine Mammal Consortium and Katy Payne, I learned that the “popcorn” sounds that you hear are the sounds the singing whale when he comes up to the surface to breathe. Do you hear the sound attenuate (weaken) as he gets nearer the surface?	Annie Lewandowski	
Hawaii	2015-01-28T17:41:33.093Z	2015-01-28T17:41:47.291Z	A ha! Perhaps the boat that we hear rev into high gear at this moment just saw the humpback whale blows following the “popcorn” sounds. Maybe they’re going to get a closer look? I hope they’re careful! [Whales are maimed and killed every year by ship strikes.](https://iwc.int/ship-strikes)	Annie Lewandowski	
Hawaii	2015-01-28T17:41:48.291Z	2015-01-28T17:42:48.088Z	Now the singer has perhaps settled back into his singing posture, vertically with his head down, to sing what we’ll call the “first” theme following the breath – a few, short upsweep sound units followed by two longer sound units, the second sound higher in frequency than the first. Recognize this theme from [16:21](#annie_first_theme)?	Annie Lewandowski	
Hawaii	2015-01-28T17:42:49.088Z	2015-01-28T17:44:35.577Z	And now the second theme after blowing - one upsweep, followed by a mid-range oscillating sustain, then a higher range oscillating sustain – we’ve heard one whole song cycle from 17:29-17:42! 	Annie Lewandowski	
Hawaii	2015-01-28T17:44:36.577Z	2015-01-28T17:46:37.827Z	Shipping noise is stressful for whales! Check out [this incredible research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3350670/pdf/rspb20112429.pdf) done by a team lead by Rosalind Rolland in which they demonstrate “that reduced ship traffic in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, following the events of 11 September 2001, resulted in a 6 dB decrease in underwater noise with a significant reduction below 150 Hz. This noise reduction was associated with decreased baseline levels of stress-related faecal hormone metabolites (glucocorticoids) in North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). This is the first evidence that exposure to low-frequency ship noise may be associated with chronic stress in whales, and has implications for all baleen whales in heavy ship traffic areas, and for recovery of this endangered right whale population.” 	Annie Lewandowski	
Hawaii	2015-01-28T17:46:38.827Z	2015-01-28T17:48:09.950Z	And look how the song evolves as we’re listening! Here we can listen to transitional material that we didn’t hear in the last iteration of the song between [the second](#annie_second_theme) and [third](#annie_third_theme) themes. Is the whale auditioning new material for a future theme? What an improviser!  	Annie Lewandowski	
Hawaii	2015-01-28T17:48:10.950Z	2015-01-28T17:56:08.742Z	And now the third theme since blowing  – one upsweep, one mid-range oscillation that’s a bit lower than the last time we heard it at [17:31](#annie_third_theme). Go on and continue listening - can you identify innovations in the themes as the breeding season moves forward, on the larger scale from this breeding season to the next?  	Annie Lewandowski	
Hawaii	2014-03-25T00:00:00.059Z	2014-03-25T00:01:14.815Z	This HARP was deployed on March 23 but we programmed it to start recording on March 25 so that we would miss all of the noisy sounds from it settling to the ocean floor. You can immediately hear a far off singing humpback. 	Ann Allen	
Hawaii	2015-02-11T09:03:17.986Z	2015-02-11T09:09:00.642Z	This is one full song from a humpback whale singing near the HARP. 	Ann Allen	
Hawaii	2015-02-11T09:08:57.553Z	2015-02-11T09:09:29.210Z	Here is a brief pause during which the whale goes to the surface to take a few breaths before starting his song over again. While he is away you can hear the faint song of other whales in the distance. 	Ann Allen
Hawaii	2015-02-11T09:05:10.098Z	2015-02-11T09:05:18.600Z	You can hear the sound of the hard drive we use to record the acoustic data spinning as it writes the data to the disk. This happens every 75 seconds. When using electronic equipment in the ocean it's super hard to get rid of all noise. (Turn off "Reduce visual noise" in settings to see the sound clearly.)	Ann Allen	
Hawaii	2015-02-11T09:09:38.883Z	2015-02-11T09:15:05.554Z	Do you notice the similarities between this song and the last song? It's the same whale singing the same song. All humpback whales in one region will sing a very similar song each year. The song changes over time and between areas of the world depending on what's trending at the time. 	Ann Allen	
Hawaii	2015-02-11T11:51:11.558Z	2015-02-11T12:24:48.629Z	Sometimes we get strange noises on the hydrophone. This sounds like something is knocking against the equipment, but we have no way of knowing what it is. Any ideas?	Ann Allen	
Hawaii	2015-02-11T16:21:24.414Z	2015-02-11T16:30:39.299Z	A small boat is passing overhead. Even little boats generate a lot of sound that can travel a long way. Imagine if you had to listen to this whine all day while you were trying to sing to a crowd?	Ann Allen	
Hawaii	2015-02-13T14:03:48.395Z	2015-02-23T07:11:46.885Z	If you zoom way out you can see a pattern of boat noise every day from sunrise to sunset. This is all of the fishing and recreational boats coming out on the ocean. They make a LOT of noise. Humans don't usually realize how noisy boats are, but it can make it hard for whales to hear each other.	Ann Allen	
Hawaii	2015-03-06T14:57:56.396Z	2015-04-24T22:20:10.018Z	We had a bit of gap here while we switched out the HARP recorders. Sometimes the batteries run out or the memory fills before we can switch out recorders so we miss some of the humpback singing that year. 	Ann Allen	
Hawaii	2015-05-10T06:47:22.438Z	2015-05-10T06:57:51.829Z	This is pretty late in the year for a humpback to still be in Hawaii. Most of them migrate to Alaska in February or March to start feeding. I thought the computer AI got it wrong until I zoomed in and found one whale still hanging around and singing faintly!	Ann Allen	
Hawaii	2015-02-19T02:29:04.260Z	2015-02-19T02:29:06.948Z	Bottom of the song, the lowest of the low, then listen to what happens… (click arrow for next comment)	David Rothenberg	
Hawaii	2015-02-19T02:31:17.192Z	2015-02-19T03:56:32.243Z	The rich rumblings of the low throom… one big syllable from the whale. Some light echoes, probably against a sea mount. On the early recordings people thought this was artificial reverb added to the mix! [Here](https://soundcloud.com/david-rothenberg-530981395/a-varied-humpback-song) you can hear this same section with the background noise taken out.	David Rothenberg	
Hawaii	2015-02-19T02:30:36.246Z	2015-02-19T02:30:42.281Z	An unusually fast rhythm, setting the stage for the rise.	David Rothenberg	
Hawaii	2015-02-19T02:30:52.521Z	2015-02-19T02:31:20.935Z	Several whales get creative, take a breath, and expand their sound palette…	David Rothenberg	
Hawaii	2015-02-19T02:31:05.255Z	2015-02-19T02:31:16.940Z	The wild whoop! This is the sound that convinced me I might reach out to the whales with my clarinet, and on one track they started to aim for a steady pitch, listen [here](http://www.thousandmilesong.com/jamming-with-whales-in-hawaii/).	David Rothenberg	
Hawaii	2015-02-19T02:36:13.572Z	2015-02-19T02:36:23.346Z	A rich resonant grumble again, followed by a clear tone, showing the real difference the spectrogram can reveal.	David Rothenberg	
Hawaii	2015-02-19T02:38:18.181Z	2015-02-19T02:38:23.027Z	How low can you go? Here, the humpback goes down into the deep frequency range of the blue whale… But the repeating pattern, clear melodic structure, assures us this is a humpback and not some other species.	David Rothenberg	
Hawaii	2015-02-19T02:38:58.758Z	2015-02-19T02:39:09.562Z	The long extended grumbling sound — by looking at the spectrogram you can see its rhythmic component that can be a bit hard to hear…	David Rothenberg	
Hawaii	2015-02-19T02:39:52.442Z	2015-02-19T02:48:35.754Z	The next several minutes really sound like a duet: two equadistant whales… somewhat unusual. How do you think they fit together?	David Rothenberg	
Hawaii	2015-02-19T02:39:58.540Z	2015-02-19T02:40:07.155Z	Three kinds of humpback syllables in a row: clicks, rise, and whistle. Each doubled because the sound is echoing off a nearby undersea surface.	David Rothenberg	
Hawaii	2015-02-19T02:40:55.751Z	2015-02-19T02:41:00.460Z	Two adjecent whales: one moans, the other nearby one whistles, seemingly in response.	David Rothenberg	
Hawaii	2015-02-19T02:38:45.845Z	2015-02-19T02:39:00.471Z	This high whoop almost sounds like a different species, but it is still a humpback. They have a wide range from low to high, similar to that of a cello or the human voice.	David Rothenberg	
Hawaii	2015-02-19T02:40:22.338Z	2015-02-19T02:41:18.500Z	Now we are really hearing an ensemble of whales. No one has really studied how these individual whale musicians interact… they aren’t really solo performers. The spectrogram shows a general descending movement slowly down, minute by minute, like a grounding, moving melody. I wanted a clearer way to visualize this whole structure, so we created [this](https://medium.com/@dealville/whales-synchronize-their-songs-across-oceans-and-theres-sheet-music-to-prove-it-b1667f603844).	David Rothenberg	
Hawaii	2015-02-19T02:41:22.114Z	2015-02-19T02:41:44.799Z	Here we hear the most famous descending humpback melody, the one that Paul Winter and others have harmonized to sound a bit like Bach, listen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09vcM449-X8) to “The Lullabye of the Great Mother Whale to the Baby Seal Pups.” [Here](https://soundcloud.com/david-rothenberg-530981395/the-most-famous-humpback-song) is a cleaner version of this section…	David Rothenberg	
Hawaii	2015-02-19T02:41:22.114Z	2015-02-19T02:41:44.799Z	[Here](https://soundcloud.com/david-rothenberg-530981395/the-most-famous-humpback-song) is a cleaner version of this section…	David Rothenberg	
Hawaii	2015-02-19T02:42:29.723Z	2015-02-19T02:43:03.690Z	You can hear the echo here, whale sound bouncing against the sea floor or a sea mount. A few researchers think the humpbacks could use these sounds as sonar, but most don’t buy that argument. There is tonal richness, the gravitas, the emotion held clearly in these songs. Humpback whale brains contain spindle neurons, previously only found in higher primates, suggesting an ability to experience and express complex emotions.	David Rothenberg	
Hawaii	2015-02-19T02:46:39.881Z	2015-02-19T02:46:39.881Z	Look at the rich complex spectrogram of this single solid tone, full of energy and pathos!	David Rothenberg	
Hawaii	2015-02-19T04:26:48.525Z	2015-02-19T04:48:42.498Z	Here is basically a clear, complete song, very early in the morning, not too much background noise. Better examples of complete whale songs can be heard here, on the compilation album I put together [New Songs of the Humpback Whale](https://importantrecords.com/products/imprec433).	David Rothenberg	
Hawaii	2015-02-19T06:11:17.648Z	2015-02-19T06:37:17.100Z	At this scale we see the intertwining songs of two nearby whales singing simultaneously.	David Rothenberg	
Hawaii	2015-06-12T22:23:17.072Z	2015-06-12T22:23:24.412Z	I think I hear a "whoop" here. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether you're hearing a whale call or imagining it, especially in the presence of noise.	Matt Harvey	
Hawaii	2015-01-31T02:39:37.857Z	2015-01-31T03:40:25.356Z	The spectrogram on the 1-hour time scale has a few repeats of what is likely the same song. Just as Pattern Radio is displaying multi-scale images, deep learning models may choose to take inputs at multiple time scales.	Matt Harvey	
Hawaii	2015-01-31T03:01:19.253Z	2015-01-31T03:01:21.883Z	About 2/3 of the way up the spectrogram, we see the same higher-frequency downsweep repeating 3 times. We hear it as reverb. Sound came from the whale to the hydrophone along multiple paths. For example it might have bounced off a reef.	Matt Harvey	
Hawaii	2015-05-30T11:32:42.228Z	2015-05-30T11:32:56.006Z	This noise from the magnetic hard disks in the HARP appears every time it powers on; it's on a cycle so it can be left out longer. Early versions of our humpback detection model sometime mistook some of these for humpback calls.	Matt Harvey	
Hawaii	2015-05-30T10:50:10.807Z	2015-05-30T10:57:35.418Z	The bright arches have a pitch trajectory similar to a humpback calls but over a longer time scale. This type of noise confused early versions of the model until we added some negative training examples.	Matt Harvey	
Hawaii	2015-05-30T20:50:26.110Z	2015-05-30T21:21:09.650Z	We don't expect humpbacks in May, which is outside the winter season, but we can still find other sounds. I guess this is a large vessel passing.	Matt Harvey	
Hawaii	2014-03-27T03:04:15.540Z	2014-03-27T03:30:42.197Z	Song interrupted. Actually the song keeps going the whole time, but it's much harder to hear over the boat noise. This effect is called masking. If the song is important to the singer's breeding prospects, this is not a win.	Matt Harvey	
Hawaii	2014-03-27T03:28:26.433Z	2014-03-27T03:28:32.252Z	Minke boing. Also confused early versions of the classifier. Scientists tell me this sound comes from a whale, but the sound is so strange that I have the urge to see for myself.	Matt Harvey	
Hawaii	2014-03-27T03:25:21.967Z	2014-03-27T03:30:15.590Z	A bunch of repeats of two song units don't vary in structure, but there is frequency modulation on the scale of minutes. We can see similar patterns at other times. Their meaning is a mystery to me.	Matt Harvey	
Hawaii	2014-03-27T02:08:44.535Z	2014-03-27T02:08:58.916Z	A modeling challenge or at least a great example to have in your eval set: humpback song and two common error modes (Minke boing and hard disk noise) were all recorded at the same time.	Matt Harvey	
Hawaii	2014-03-26T13:31:28.007Z	2014-03-26T13:32:29.275Z	There's song in this section, but it's very faint, probably because the whale is far away. Zoom out to see it surrounded by louder sections. My deep net machine learning model worked better than my ears for faint calls.	Matt Harvey	
Hawaii	2014-06-08T12:08:29.083Z	2014-06-13T15:13:04.583Z	Day/night cycle is apparent from a spectrogram whose time scale is days. It's louder in the daytime. (The times displayed in the UI are UTC, so shifted from Hawaii time.)	Matt Harvey	
Hawaii	2015-05-12T05:20:37.809Z	2015-05-12T06:50:17.746Z	In the upper third of the spectrogram, we see that the spectrum of the background noise is varying independent of sounds that are louder or have quicker onsets. Could it be caused by some large-scale oceanic condition?	Matt Harvey	
Hawaii	2014-05-06T05:58:44.123Z	2014-05-06T06:00:01.777Z	May is late season for humpbacks in Hawaii, but it sounds like someone's still around, albeit a bit distant.	Matt Harvey	
Hawaii	2014-12-27T01:57:31.391Z	2014-12-27T02:14:26.855Z	This is a boat passing overhead. The thing that I found strange is that the doppler effect is actually flipped. Usually the pitch would rise as something approaches you and fall as it goes away. This inverse doppler effect caused by sound bouncing off the ocean floor is called Lloyd's Mirror. 	Yotam Mann	
Hawaii	2014-12-07T04:29:50.920Z	2014-12-07T04:29:57.619Z	I'm not sure what this mechanical noise is. It looks similar to the other boat engines in terms of having a loud harmonic  sound, but it doesn't have the same doppler shift as the other boats, it might be a boat standing overhead.	Yotam Mann	
Hawaii	2014-06-14T12:44:28.181Z	2014-06-17T06:34:41.955Z	There is a really clear day/night pattern of activity which becomes really apparent at certain zoom levels. It seems like there might also be boats which pass overhead at around the same time each day. I wonder if it's possible to figure out the ferry schedule from studying these spectrograms.

Hawaii	2014-12-06T07:13:51.065Z	2014-12-06T07:13:54.565Z	The [HARP](http://cetus.ucsd.edu/technologies_AutonomousRecorders.html) (High-Frequency Acoustic Recording Package) combines a sensitive hydrophone (underwater microhpone) with 12 spinning hard drive disks in a water-tight container. You can hear the hard drive spinning up here. Turn off the denoising to see the sound more clearly in the spectrogram. 	Yotam Mann	
Hawaii	2014-12-06T07:13:54.893Z	2014-12-06T07:14:04.983Z	Immediately after you hear the disk spin up, there is an electronic or mechanical sound that lasts for about 10 seconds. I think that might be the disks write-head or some sort of electrical hum associated with the disk spinning up.	Yotam Mann	
Hawaii	2014-12-07T04:29:50.920Z	2014-12-07T04:29:57.619Z	The HARP is designed to live on the ocean floor for 6 to 12 months. It stores the audio in small audio chunks around a minute long. The spectrograms are generated from these small chunks, so occasionally you can see where one audio file ends and another begins. In this recording of a boat passing overhead, you can see a small discontinuity as a vertical seam immediately before the disk spins up to write another chunk of sound.	Yotam Mann	
Hawaii	2015-02-10T10:33:14.276Z	2015-02-10T10:33:27.538Z	Here you can see an artifact of our denoising algorithm. It essentially subtracted out the repeated HARP noise. 	Yotam Mann	
Hawaii	2015-01-15T01:57:06.698Z	2015-01-21T20:07:02.683Z	This tour starts with a one-week view of an acoustic scene. Follow the comments in order to zoom in and explore the different types of sounds that contribute to the scene. In the week view, do you see a pattern in the sounds? What do you think the cause of this pattern might be?	Chris Clark	
Hawaii	2015-01-17T10:09:06.269Z	2015-01-19T05:01:52.977Z	Now we zoom into a two-day section of this same acoustic scene. What visual features of this more zoomed in look catch your eye? Can you hear differences between different parts of this time period? Are there visual features that you can see on the spectrogram but not hear?	Chris Clark	chris_two
Hawaii	2015-01-17T23:57:09.238Z	2015-01-18T05:29:02.482Z	Now we're in a five-hour section of our acoustic scene. What features catch your eye? Can you see these features in [the two-day zoom level](#chris_two)? Can you hear differences between different parts of this scene? At this level, are there acoustic features you can hear but not see?	Chris Clark	
Hawaii	2015-01-18T03:31:25.930Z	2015-01-18T04:19:49.002Z	We're zooming in even further to a 45 minute view of our scene. What features catch your eye? Can you see these features in [the two-day zoom level](#chris_two)? Can you hear differences between different parts of this scene? Are there acoustic features you can hear but not see?	Chris Clark	
Hawaii	2015-01-18T09:46:22.945Z	2015-01-18T12:36:56.890Z	Now let's zoom out again and think again about what features are catching your eye. Can you hear differences between different parts of this scene? Are there acoustic features you can hear but not see?	Chris Clark	
Hawaii	2015-01-19T03:43:45.562Z	2015-01-19T04:01:27.852Z	Now we're zooming back in, this time to a 12-minute view. What do we hear now? Do you hear a whale singing? What else do you hear?  Can you see other sounds on the spectrogram that you hear in this scene? What do you think these sounds are?	Chris Clark	
Hawaii	2015-01-20T23:19:58.179Z	2015-01-20T23:21:20.987Z	And now we're at a two-minute zoom level. What's different about what you see and hear at this level? Do you prefer to listen and watch when the scene is zoomed in or zoomed out? Why is that? What can you and can’t you observe using different zoom levels and acoustic scene durations?	Chris Clark
